## Installation
We recommend downloading this repository to your local folder.
## Contents
### Algorithms 1~5
Algorithms 1~5 are all listed on section 5 of the reference.
### Sample
Here we provided some sample codes to test the accuracy of our tropical svm under four different theorems
### lp_solver
This algorithm solves the linear programming on section 4 of the reference, which is much slower and does not find the feasible data set.
